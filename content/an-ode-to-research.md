_A poetic reflection to mark my completion of an entire year in full-time research. Authored by myself and claude 3.5._ 
<center>

'*How is work?*' they ask with care, <br>
I pause and take a breath to share.  <br>
My models learn through day and night,  <br>
While gradients flow, seeking light.  <br>
The errors dance, they propagate,  <br>
As attention heads participate.  <br>
Each tensor shifts, each value flows,  <br>
Into dimensions no one knows.  <br>

Should I mention the tensors?  
The hyperparameters I'm tuning?  
Their eyes are already glazing,  
Like my GPU when overfitting.  

'_It's going okay,_' I reply,  
A practiced smile and nod,  
Knowing my twenty-minute spiel  
Would leave them just as lost.  

For how do I explain  
That single line of code  
That took three months to debug  
And countless papers to decode?  

My research lives in footnotes,  
In parenthetical asides,  
In that narrow space between  
What was and what could be derived.  

Some days I chase equations  
Through labyrinthine proofs,  
Other days I'm wrestling  
With CUDA out of memory truths.  

So when you ask about work,  
And I fumble for the words,  
Know that in my silence lies  
A universe of learning curves.  

For in this niche I've carved,  
This hyperspecific space,  
There's beauty in the details  
That time cannot erase.  

'_It's computational,_' I say at last,  
And leave it at just that,  
While in my mind, algorithms dance  
Like cats chasing laser paths.
