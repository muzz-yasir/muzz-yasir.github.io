I'm a research assistant in the [AI for Cyber Defence (AICD) Lab](https://www.turing.ac.uk/aicd) at the Alan Turing Institute, advised by [Chris Hicks](https://chrishicks.io/) and [Vasilious Mavroudis](https://mavroud.is/). Our lab aims ensure the security and privacy of computer networks and systems through fundamental and applied advances in autonomous defence agents. 

Prior to joining AICD, I got my bachelors in discrete mathematics at Warwick and worked on graph learning for my undergraduate dissertation. I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Long Tran-Thanh](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/long_tran-thanh/) at Warwick along with [Bryan Perozzi](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=rZgbMs4AAAAJ&hl=en), [John Palowitch](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fguoChwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Anton Tsitsulin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hssTYQMAAAAJ) at Google Research to work on their GNN-benchmarking suite, GraphWorld.
